          <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Grafana 4.0 Brings Major Enhancements to Leading Visualization Tool</h2>
          <h3>Combined with the Latest Releases of Snap and Graphite, raintank Offers a Complete, Supported, and Fully Open Monitoring Stack.</h3>

          <p><strong class="text-light">November 30, 2016 – NEW YORK, NY (GrafanaCon)</strong> – raintank, the team behind popular time-series data visualization tool <a href="http://grafana.org" target="_blank">Grafana</a>, announced the release of Grafana 4.0 today at GrafanaCon. With the latest update, Grafana now offers alerting, which transforms the visualization dashboard into a powerful monitoring tool. It also includes hundreds of new updates, many of which improve its functionality and user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to Grafana 4.0, Snap, the open telemetry platform from Intel, and time-series database Graphite, also announced major milestones. These three leading components let users easily analyze, collect and store a wide range of disparate time series metrics. Together, they combine to form a complete, and fully open source monitoring stack that will underpin fully supported offerings from raintank.</p>
<p><strong class="text-light">Grafana 4.0:</strong> Most commonly used in Internet application and infrastructure analytics, Grafana is increasingly finding uses for IoT, sensor data, financial modeling, and industrial process control, and more. Torkel Odegaard, creator of Grafana (http://grafana.org) and co-founder of raintank, said: “Alerting is a really revolutionary feature for Grafana, because it extends its capabilities as a visualization tool into a mission critical, real-time monitoring tool. This fourth major release caps off an incredible year for Grafana, which saw the project accelerate to over 50,000 reported active installations”</p>
<p><strong class="text-light">Snap 1.0:</strong> Intel has released version 1.0 of Snap (link: ITPN), its open source telemetry platform. Snap is designed to simplify the collection, processing and publishing of system data through a single API. With its latest update, Snap now features production-ready stability, enhanced operational experience, and multi-language plugin support for Go, Python, and C/++.</p>
<p>“Grafana has proven to be an ideal dashboard for visualizing the telemetry data collected by Snap,” said Jonathan Donaldson, VP/GM, Software Defined Infrastructure Group at Intel. “The rollout of Grafana 4.0, combined with the latest enhancements in Snap 1.0, give enterprises an even more powerful way to monitor the performance of applications and infrastructure, and gives them the insights they need to further maximize the efficiencies and performance of these systems.”</p>
<p><strong class="text-light">Graphite 1.0:</strong> <a href="http://graphiteapp.org" target="_blank">The Graphite project</a> also announced a preview of Graphite 1.0. Graphite is one of the most popular open source time series databases amongst by Grafana users. raintank has become a recent champion of Graphite, driving the launch of a new website and logo, and hiring maintainer Jason Dixon to help accelerate the project. Graphite 1.X will give users a choice of storage backends, including an upcoming highly scalable option from raintank.</p>
<p>Time-series data has rapidly become a distinct category, with its own unique set of challenges and requirements. Traditional relational databases like Oracle, as well as newer NoSQL databases like MongoDB are not appropriate for this kind of specialized data. According to DB-Engines, which ranks the popularity of database technologies, time-series databases were the fastest growing data management category over the last year. Grafana is the de facto visualization software for most of the top 10 databases in that category, including Graphite, Prometheus, and InfluxDB.</p>
