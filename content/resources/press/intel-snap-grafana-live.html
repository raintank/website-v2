          <h2>RAINTANK ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF GRAFANA.NET</h2>
          <h3>Collaboration with Intel improves Grafana infrastructure control</h3>
          
          <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA – March 31 2016 – raintank, the company behind <a href="http://grafana.org">Grafana</a>, today announced the beta launch of <a href="http://grafana.net">Grafana.net</a>, and a strategic collaboration with Intel.</p>
<p>Grafana, created in 2014 by raintank co-founder Torkel Odegaard, has become the de facto open-source solution for visualizing cloud telemetry data, and is actively used by hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<p>With the shift from servers to virtual machines to containers, the advent of microservices, and the desire to “monitor everything”, many organizations have lost control of their monitoring. They are stuck with expensive, proprietary and disparate tools that can’t cope with today’s public and private cloud deployments.</p>
<p>Grafana.net is raintank’s answer to that problem, and the perfect complement to Grafana. It allows organizations to discover, create and share Grafana plugins and dashboards, and provides a scalable Graphite-compatible data source. All of this is backed by up to 24x7x365 support, no matter where Grafana is deployed.</p>
<p>The Intel collaboration will focus on the recently announced open source <a href="https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap">Snap cloud telemetry agent</a>. Snap provides a central access point for applications like Grafana to tap underlying platform attributes to more efficiently assign services to optimized infrastructure. The companies will work together to build solutions to expose, store, visualize, and alert on deep platform telemetry from both infrastructure and applications. These fully-supported solutions will be available on Grafana.net, starting with a <a href="http://grafana.net/plugins/raintank-snap-app">Grafana Snap data source</a> that is available today.</p>
<p>“I believe strongly in democratizing metrics, and in open source software. That’s why I started writing Grafana. I’m pleased that we are doubling down on both with today’s beta launch of Grafana.net.”, said Torkel Odegaard, creator of Grafana and raintank co-founder.</p>
<p>”Efficient utilization of data center infrastructure is a key benefit of software defined infrastructure,” said Jonathan Donaldson, vice president of software defined infrastructure for Intel’s Data Center Group.  “Solutions like Grafana.net deliver improved control of workload assignment based on the underlying physical infrastructure ensuring that each workload is running on an optimal configuration. The collaboration on grafana.net is a great proof point to industry momentum behind Snap and testament of the value of tighter infrastructure management to data center operators.”</p>
<p>“We believe that just like infrastructure software, open source is going to win for monitoring. Snap will be a key piece in our stack, and we’re thrilled to be working on it with Intel.”, said Raj Dutt, raintank co-founder and CEO.</p>
