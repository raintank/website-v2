        <h4 class="text-light">1.0 Roadmap</h4>
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Improved User Experience</strong></h5>
        <p>Questions like <em>"how will this affect the user"</em> and <em>"how can I remove this source of friction"</em> are considered in every feature decision.</p>
        
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Storage Finders</strong></h5>
        <p>This feature allows developers to build custom backends (or refit existing ones) for the Graphite API, making it possible to swap out your aging Whisper cluster for something more suited to your specific needs or operational expertise.</p>
      
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Streamlining Installation and Setup</strong></h5>
        <p>The <a href="http://graphiteapp.org/quick-start-guides/synthesize.html">Synthesize project</a> is available to help anyone get a Graphite sandbox up and running in no time. It supports Vagrant for launching either Graphite stable (0.9.x) or experimental (pre-1.0) releases, or even a DigitalOcean button for launching your own stable Graphite droplet in minutes.</p>

        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Increased Cadence of Work</strong></h5>
        <p>The health of any open source project is measured by its community, and you need a reliable cadence of work to maintain interest and contributions. The volume of contributions, issues, and community conversations around Graphite use and development has risen steadily over the last few months and will continue to do so.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">1.1 Roadmap</h4>
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>PRs and Issues</strong></h5>
        <p>Clearing out the backlog of PRs and issues will allow us to focus on new innovations for Graphite after version 1.0. 
        
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Core Enhancements</strong></h5>
        It's always been our intent (speaking vaguely on behalf of the Graphite core team) to introduce new storage backends, "pluggable" (read: user-defined) functions, access controls, etc., and with the glut of old contributions finally merged we can finally invest time towards these features.</p>

        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Support</strong></h5>
        <p>Documentation, installation processes, and troubleshooting primitives will continue to advance. It's important to completely understand the various log messages, their meaning, their inconsistent use across classes and services, and being able to toggle them on or off according to need.</p>

        <p>Getting Graphite 1.x on track is just the beginning. We’re thinking bigger, and more long term.</p>

        <p class="lead">We want to make key improvements to Graphite in the following areas:</p>
        <h4 class="text-light">Performance</h4>
        <p>The volume and velocity of todays metrics require the utmost in performance and scalability.</p>
        <br />
        <h4 class="text-light">Tagging</h4>
        <p>Rich insights require rich metadata. Metrics should be more structured, standardized, and self describing. (See <a href="http://www.metrics20.org">http://www.metrics20.org</a>)</p>
        <br />
        <h4 class="text-light">Ease of Operation</h4>
        <p>Graphite should be easier to install and scale, both for the very small users as well as the massively large.</p>
        <p>Talk, unlike code, is cheap. Over the last several months, we’ve taken the first steps in addressing some of these problems: metrictank and carbon-relay-ng.</p>
