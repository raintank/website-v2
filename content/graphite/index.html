        <p>Recently, we wrote a <a href="https://blog.raintank.io/dear-graphite-users-and-developers/?utm-source=Graphite_page" data-gacategory="Link" data-gaaction="Graphite" data-galabel="Graphite page">blog post</a> announcing an exciting addition to our team, as well as our vision to help revive the Graphite project through new resources, events, support and improvements to the codebase. We understand that this project is and always will be opensource, but we feel it’s our duty as good citizens to help where we can. Now we’d like to shed some more light on the subject.</p>

        <h3 class="text-light">The road to Graphite 1.0</h3>
        <p>In June 2016, we were excited to announce Jason Dixon (<a href="http://twitter.com/obfuscurity">@obfuscurity</a>) has joined the raintank team with the expressed focus on providing full-time attention to moving Graphite forward and working with the Graphite community. As the unofficial project maintainer, as well as the author of the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035794.do">Graphite book</a> from O'Reilly, we're extremely excited to have such a talented and knowledgeable resource on our team full time.
        <p>You can see in a <a href="https://blog.raintank.io/approaching-graphite-1-0/">follow up blog post</a> some of the specifics of what we've been up to, features of the upcoming 1.0 and 1.1 releases, the <a href="http://graphiteapp.org">new website</a> we launched and the <a href="https://grafana.net/support/plans">support plans</a> we're offering for the project.

        <br />
        <br />
        <h4 class="text-light">1.0 Roadmap</h4>
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Improved overall user experience</strong></h5>
        <p>Questions like <em>"how will this affect the user"</em> and <em>"how can I remove this source of friction"</em> are considered in every feature decision.</p>
        
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Storage Finders</strong></h5>
        <p>This feature allows developers to build custom backends (or refit existing ones) for the Graphite API, making it possible to swap out your aging Whisper cluster for something more suited to your specific needs or operational expertise.</p>
      
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Streamlining Installation and Setup</strong></h5>
        <p>The <a href="http://graphiteapp.org/quick-start-guides/synthesize.html">Synthesize project</a> is available to help anyone get a Graphite sandbox up and running in no time. It supports Vagrant for launching either Graphite stable (0.9.x) or experimental (pre-1.0) releases, or even a DigitalOcean button for launching your own stable Graphite droplet in minutes.</p>

        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Increased Cadence of Work</strong></h5>
        <p>The health of any open source project is measured by its community, and you need a reliable cadence of work to maintain interest and contributions. The volume of contributions, issues, and community conversations around Graphite use and development has risen steadily over the last few months and will continue to do so.</p>


        <br />
        <h4 class="text-light">1.1 Roadmap</h4>
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>PRs and Issues</strong></h5>
        <p>Clearing out the backlog of PRs and issues will allow us to focus on new innovations for Graphite after version 1.0. 
        
        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Core Enhancements</strong></h5>
        It's always been our intent (speaking vaguely on behalf of the Graphite core team) to introduce new storage backends, "pluggable" (read: user-defined) functions, access controls, etc., and with the glut of old contributions finally merged we can finally invest time towards these features.</p>

        <h5 class="text-light"><strong>Support</strong></h5>
        <p>Documentation, installation processes, and troubleshooting primitives will continue to advance. It's important to completely understand the various log messages, their meaning, their inconsistent use across classes and services, and being able to toggle them on or off according to need.</p>

        <h3 class="text-light">Our future vision for Graphite</h3>
        
        <p>Getting Graphite 1.x on track is just the beginning. We’re thinking bigger, and more long term.</p>
        <p>We want to make key improvements to Graphite in the following areas:</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">Performance</h4>
        <p>The volume and velocity of todays metrics require the utmost in performance and scalability.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">Tagging</h4>
        <p>Rich insights require rich metadata. Metrics should be more structured, standardized, and self describing. (See <a href="http://www.metrics20.org">http://www.metrics20.org</a>)</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">Ease of Operation</h4>
        <p>Graphite should be easier to install and scale, both for the very small users as well as the massively large.</p>
        <p>Talk, unlike code, is cheap. Over the last several months, we’ve taken the first steps in addressing some of these problems: metrictank and carbon-relay-ng.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">about</h4>
        <p>Announcing the first step in our journey to create a new and modern Graphite-compatible stack for large environments: metrictank.</p>
        <p>metrictank is a high performance replacement for carbon and whisper.</p>

        <h3 class="text-light">Features</h3>

        <h4 class="text-light">high performance</h4>
        <p>Scale to many millions of series, ingest large amounts of data, and enjoy lightning quick responses. All while using a fraction of the storage.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">100% Graphite compatible</h4>
        <p>We love Graphite, and its extensive query language. metrictank is fully compatible and works seamlessly with all your existing tools and dashboards.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">Built with proven tech</h4>
        <p>Need clustering that “just works”? metrictank uses the proven, rock-solid Cassandra for highly reliable clustered storage that works at massive scale.</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">Metrics 2.0</h4>
        <p>We created metrics 2.0, and metrictank aims to offer all of its advantages. This will include tags in Graphite, automatic units in your Dashboards, and many other awesome improvements!</p>

        <h4 class="text-light">OpenSaaS</h4>
        <p>metrictank is completely open source, but also available as hosted offering, so that you can leave the heavy lifting to us. We believe in choices, not lock-in.</p>
