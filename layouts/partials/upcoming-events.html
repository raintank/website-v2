        <p><span class="text-light"><strong>Building  a Snap Telemetry Plugin</strong></span> Snap is an open telemetry framework by Intel designed to simplify the collection, processing and publishing of system data through a single API.</p>

        <p>In an environment with huge amounts of data, Snap simplifies the gathering of measurements. It can dynamically load new collector plugins and new measurements without having to stop and restart. This means you can collect new metrics in real-time when you need them. Written in Go, it is highly performant and inherently scalable with its built-in clustering mechanism.</p>

        <p>Staples are on the forefront of introducing Snap into their stack and joining us will be Jacob Lisi, a software developer on the Staples SRE Instrumentation team. Jacob will show us how to build a Snap plugin, live at the podium, without a net.</p>

        <p>Anything can go wrong! Danger! Intrigue! Telemetry! Snapping turtles!</p>
